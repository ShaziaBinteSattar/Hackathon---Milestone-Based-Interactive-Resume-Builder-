# Hackathon---Milestone-Based-Interactive-Resume-Builder-

Overview: 
This hackathon challenges you to build a complete Interactive Resume Builder step-by-step, 
divided into five key milestones. Each milestone builds upon the previous one, taking you from a 
static resume to a fully dynamic, editable, and shareable online resume. You can work from home, 
completing as many milestones as you can within the 24-hour time frame. 

Hackathon Structure: 

 The hackathon is divided into 5 milestones. 
 Each milestone carries 100 points. 
 You can submit your progress for each completed milestone. 
 Aim to complete as many milestones as possible within the 24-hour limit. 


**Milestone 1: Static Interactive Resume Builder (100 Points) **

Build a static resume using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. 
Requirements: 
 Create a static resume with sections like: 
o Personal Information (Name, Contact Details, Profile Picture) 
o Education 
o Skills 
o Work Experience 
 Use TypeScript to add basic interactivity, such as a button to toggle the visibility of the 
"Skills" section or other sections. 
Scoring Breakdown: 
 HTML Structure and Completeness (40 points): 
o Are all sections (Personal Info, Education, Skills, etc.) clearly created using proper 
HTML structure? 
 CSS Styling and Responsive Design (40 points): 
o Does the resume look visually appealing and function well across mobile and 
desktop devices? 
 Basic TypeScript Functionality (20 points): 
o Are there buttons or any interactivity implemented (e.g., show/hide sections)? 


**Milestone 2: Publish on GitHub and Host on Vercel (100 Points) **
Objective: 
Publish your static resume created in Milestone 1 to GitHub and deploy it live using Vercel. 
Requirements: 
 Push the project code to a GitHub repository. 
 Deploy the project on Vercel so that the resume is publicly accessible. 
Scoring Breakdown: 
 GitHub Repository Setup and Organization (50 points): 
o Is the code properly committed and pushed to a GitHub repository? 
o Is the repository well-organized with proper folder structures and file naming 
conventions? 
 Successful Deployment on Vercel (50 points): 
o Is the resume successfully deployed and accessible online via Vercel? 

**Milestone 3: Dynamic Resume Builder with Form (100 Points) **

Objective: 
Convert the static resume into a Dynamic Resume Builder where users can fill out a form, and the 
resume is generated based on their input. 
Requirements: 
 Create a form to capture user input for: 
o Personal Information (Name, Email, etc.) 
o Education 
o Work Experience 
o Skills 
 Use TypeScript to dynamically generate the resume using the data provided through the 
form. 
Scoring Breakdown: 
 Form Design and Validation (40 points): 
o Does the form collect all necessary details in a user-friendly manner? 
o Is validation implemented to ensure that all fields are filled correctly (e.g., 
mandatory fields)? 
 Dynamic Resume Generation (40 points): 
o Does the form correctly populate the resume with user input? 
o Is the resume updated in real-time without refreshing the page? 
 User Experience and Functionality (20 points): 
o Is the form-to-resume generation smooth and functional? 



**Milestone 4: Editable Resume (100 Points) **
Objective: 
Make the generated resume editable after it’s created. 
Requirements: 
 Implement the ability for users to click on sections of the resume (e.g., Education, Work 
Experience) and directly edit them. 
 Ensure the changes are reflected immediately without reloading the page. 
Scoring Breakdown: 
 Editable Functionality Implementation (60 points): 
o Is each section of the resume editable (i.e., can users click and modify content)? 
o Are changes reflected without requiring a page refresh? 
 TypeScript Code Quality and Logic (40 points): 
o Is the TypeScript code organized, eAicient, and error-free? 




**Milestone 5: Unique Path and Shareable Link (100 Points) **
Objective: 
Generate a unique URL for each resume based on the user’s username, and allow the resume to be 
shared and downloaded. 
Requirements: 
 When a user creates a resume, generate a unique URL, for example: 
username.vercel.app/resume. 
 Provide options for users to share their resume via a link and download the resume as a 
PDF. 

Scoring Breakdown: 


 Unique URL Generation (50 points): 
o Does the system generate a unique path for each user’s resume based on their 
username? 
 Link Sharing and PDF Download (50 points): 
o Can users share their resume link, and does the download function work properly?
